# Scripts
All Scripts transferred from Jarad to me for Adafruit

This repo contains all of Jarad's Adafruit python scripts and any docs which they generate. It's organized like this:

-> department
-> type_of_project
-> project_name
-> project_subfolders
-> project_elements

You can see all of the .py scripts which contain the Python and R libraries/functions I use frequently, along with all the data-pulls for shipping, fab, and part data. Go to Fake_Folder_Copy > Python/R_Libraries.
